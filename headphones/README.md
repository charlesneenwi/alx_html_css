Responsive Web Page Requirements

This project focuses on creating a clean, responsive, and user-friendly web page. Below are the key guidelines and interaction notes to follow while building the interface.

Core Requirements
1. Mobile Responsiveness:
The layout must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.

Use CSS media queries to restructure components, adjust typography, and simplify layout for small screens.

2. Content Layout:
The entire content area should have a maximum width of 1000px.

Content must be centered horizontally on the page.

This helps maintain clean readability on large screens.

3. Link Interactions:
On hover or active states, all links should change color to: #FF6565.

This ensures consistent feedback across the UI.ens.

4. Button Interactions:
Buttons should become slightly dimmer on interaction: opacity: 0.9 on hover or active.
